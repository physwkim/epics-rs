//! Downstream CA server adapter for the gateway.
//!
//! Hosts a [`CaServer`] backed by a shadow [`PvDatabase`]. The shadow
//! database is populated by the [`UpstreamManager`] as upstream
//! subscriptions establish. Downstream clients see PVs as if they
//! were normal in-process PVs — the gateway is transparent on the wire.
//!
//! ## Pre-registration vs lazy resolution
//!
//! The current implementation pre-registers all PVs from the `.pvlist`
//! at gateway startup, eagerly subscribing to each upstream. This differs
//! from C++ ca-gateway, which uses lazy on-demand resolution: a downstream
//! search triggers an upstream search, and the PV is added to the cache
//! only after the upstream IOC responds.
//!
//! Lazy resolution requires a search-hook in `epics-base-rs::PvDatabase`
//! that calls back into the gateway when an unknown name is searched.
//! That hook doesn't exist yet — adding it is a future enhancement.
//! Pre-registration works for any pvlist where the patterns are
//! enumerable (literal names) or where you're willing to subscribe
//! to a known set of upstream PVs at startup.
