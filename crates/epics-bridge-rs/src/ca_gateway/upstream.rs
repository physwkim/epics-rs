//! Upstream CA client adapter for the gateway.
//!
//! Manages connections to upstream IOCs via [`epics_ca_rs::client::CaClient`].
//! When a downstream client first searches for a PV, the gateway uses
//! `UpstreamManager` to:
//!
//! 1. Create a CA channel to the upstream IOC
//! 2. Subscribe with a monitor + a one-shot GET to learn the native type
//! 3. Spawn a task that forwards events into the [`PvCache`] and a
//!    shadow [`PvDatabase`] (which the downstream CaServer queries)
//! 4. Install a [`WriteHook`] on the shadow PV so client-originated
//!    writes are forwarded upstream rather than landing locally
//!
//! When the last downstream subscriber leaves, the upstream channel is
//! kept alive (Inactive state) until the cache cleanup timer evicts it.
//!
//! ## Shadow PvDatabase pattern
//!
//! The gateway uses two stores in parallel:
//!
//! - [`PvCache`] — gateway's view (state machine, subscriber list, stats)
//! - [`PvDatabase`] — `epics-ca-rs::server::CaServer`'s view (the actual
//!   PVs that downstream clients see)
//!
//! Both are kept in sync: every upstream event updates `PvCache.cached`
//! AND posts to the shadow `PvDatabase` via `put_pv_and_post()`, which
//! triggers the CaServer to fan out monitor events to all attached
//! downstream clients.
//!
//! ## Auto-restart
//!
//! The monitor-forwarding task wraps `channel.subscribe()` in an
//! exponential-backoff retry loop so a transient upstream disconnect
//! does not strand the cache entry forever (the entry's `cached`
//! snapshot would otherwise be served indefinitely while no further
//! events arrive). On terminal failure the entry transitions to the
//! `Disconnect` state, which the cleanup tick eventually evicts.
