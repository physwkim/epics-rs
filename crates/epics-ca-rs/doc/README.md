# epics-ca-rs Documentation

Internal architecture and protocol reference for the Rust Channel
Access (CA) implementation.

This directory documents how `epics-ca-rs` is built and how it maps to
the EPICS CA wire protocol. The intended audience is anyone modifying
the crate or trying to understand a runtime issue. End-user usage
(building a client, running an IOC) belongs in the top-level
`README.md`.

## Reading order

If you're new to the codebase:

1. `01-overview.md` — get the big picture and the module map.
2. `02-wire-protocol.md` — understand the bytes on the wire so the
   handler code reads naturally.
3. Pick `03-client.md` or `04-server.md` depending on which side you're
   touching.
4. `05-state-machines.md` for connection-lifecycle questions.
5. The remaining docs are reference material — read on demand.

## Conventions

- File / line references use `crate/file.rs:line` so you can navigate
  in any editor.
- Wire-protocol byte layouts are shown as `byte offset: field name`
  tables.
- "libca" refers to the C reference client in
  `epics-base/modules/ca/src/client/`. "rsrv" refers to the C server in
  `epics-base/modules/database/src/ioc/rsrv/`.
- "channel id" (cid) is allocated by the client; "server id" (sid) is
  assigned by the server on `CA_PROTO_CREATE_CHAN`.

## Contributing

When changing CA behaviour:

1. Update the relevant doc page under `doc/` if the protocol- or
   architecture-level invariants change.
2. Add or extend a test under `crates/epics-ca-rs/tests/` if behaviour
   is observable.
3. Verify against a real `softIoc` via the interop suite
   (`cargo test -p epics-ca-rs --tests -- --test-threads=1`).
