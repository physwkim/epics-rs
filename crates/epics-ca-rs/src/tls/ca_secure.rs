//! Compatibility stub for the upstream `epics-base` "ca-secure"
//! TLS proposal.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Not yet shipped in any released `epics-base`. The upstream
//! design is moving — what's here tracks the public discussion as
//! of `epics-base` 7.x development branches and may need rework
//! when the spec stabilizes.
//!
//! Sources we're tracking:
//!
//! - <https://docs.epics-controls.org/projects/base/en/latest/secure-channel-access.html>
//!   (intermittent — may 404)
//! - `epics-base` mailing list ("ca-secure" thread, ongoing)
//! - upstream Slack `#secure-ca`
//!
//! ## What ca-secure intends
//!
//! - **Inline TLS upgrade**: client and server start in plaintext,
//!   negotiate TLS via a CA-level capability flag, then upgrade the
//!   stream in-place (StartTLS pattern). Requires a wire bit not
//!   currently in `CA_PROTO_VERSION`.
//! - **mTLS-driven identity**: subjects from the client cert flow
//!   into the rsrv ASG check (replacing host+username matching when
//!   present).
//! - **Wire compat**: a server speaking ca-secure must still answer
//!   plaintext clients on the same TCP port — TLS is a per-channel
//!   capability, not a port-level discriminator.
//!
//! ## What this crate currently ships
//!
//! - `experimental-rust-tls`: an immediate-TLS variant — the entire
//!   TCP stream is wrapped in TLS from byte zero. Interoperable only
//!   with other Rust clients/servers in the same trust pool.
//!
//! ## Negotiation mode
//!
//! [`TlsMode`] selects which wire format the server speaks.
//! - `RustOnly`     — current `experimental-rust-tls` behaviour
//! - `CaSecureDraft` — placeholder; the negotiation hooks below
//!   record the intent but defer to RustOnly until the upstream
//!   spec stabilizes.
//!
//! Pick the mode via `EPICS_CAS_TLS_MODE`. Unset = `RustOnly`.
//!
//! ## What landing real ca-secure requires
//!
//! 1. New `CA_PROTO_VERSION` capability bit (upstream needs to
//!    finalize the value).
//! 2. A handshake state machine in `tcp.rs` that tolerates plaintext
//!    framing for the first message, then optionally upgrades.
//! 3. mTLS subject extraction wired into the existing ACF identity
//!    path (already done for `experimental-rust-tls`; reuse
//!    `crate::tls::identity_from_cert`).
//! 4. Interop test against a real `epics-base` 7 build with the same
//!    feature enabled — track-the-spec is fundamentally a moving
//!    target so this acceptance gate matters.
