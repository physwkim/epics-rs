//! Per-PV channel state machine.
//!
//! A [`Channel`] is the long-lived handle through which ops (GET / PUT /
//! MONITOR / RPC) reach a server. Internally:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Idle
//!     │  ensure_active()
//!     ▼
//!   Searching ────► Connecting ────► Active
//!     ▲                                 │
//!     │  ServerConn closed              │
//!     └─────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! Multiple ops can ride on the same channel concurrently: each gets a
//! fresh `ioid` and registers with the underlying [`ServerConn`] router.
//! Reconnect is **automatic** and transparent to monitor consumers — see
//! [`crate::client_native::ops_v2::op_monitor_handle`] for the loop that
//! re-issues INIT/START on each new server conn.
