# epics-pva-rs Documentation

Internal architecture and protocol reference for the Rust pvAccess
(PVA) implementation.

This directory documents how `epics-pva-rs` is built and how it maps
to the EPICS pvAccess wire protocol. The intended audience is anyone
modifying the crate or trying to understand a runtime issue. End-user
usage (running a server, building a client) belongs in the top-level
`README.md`.

## Reading order

If you're new to the codebase:

1. `01-overview.md` — module map and the upstream-parity model.
2. `02-wire-protocol.md` — how PVA frames are laid out on the wire.
3. `03-pvdata-types.md` — the type system every op carries.
4. Pick `04-client.md` or `05-server.md` depending on which side
   you're touching.
5. `06-state-machines.md` for reconnect / monitor lifecycle.
6. The remaining docs are reference material — read on demand.

## Conventions

- File / line references use `crate/file.rs:line` so you can navigate
  in any editor.
- "pvxs" refers to the C++ reference implementation upstream
  ([github.com/mdavidsaver/pvxs](https://github.com/mdavidsaver/pvxs));
  "p2pApp" refers to the legacy C++ PVA gateway in `pva2pva/p2pApp`.
- "channel id" (cid) is client-allocated; "server id" (sid) is server-
  allocated on `CMD_CREATE_CHANNEL`.
- `ioid` (operation id) is per-op (per get / put / monitor), client-
  allocated, scoped to its parent sid.

## Contributing

When changing PVA behaviour:

1. Update the relevant doc page under `doc/` if a protocol- or
   architecture-level invariant changes.
2. Add or extend a test under `crates/epics-pva-rs/tests/` (or the
   parity test fixtures) if behaviour is observable.
3. Run `cargo test -p epics-pva-rs --all-features` before committing.
